The Quick Brown Fox—yes, THAT fox—jumped over 13 lazy dogs! 🦊🐶🐶🐶  
Isn't it strange? Some dogs barked, some didn’t... others just yawned.  
Meanwhile, Mr. Fox whispered: “speed > strength; timing == everything.”  

DATA LOG [EXPERIMENT #42]:

Random mix of tokens, numbers, and symbols — test@domain.com, #hashtag, $money$, 100%, C++, Python3, and pseudo-code:
    if (fox.energy > 50 && !dogs.sleeping) then
        fox.jump();
    else
        dogs.snore("zzz");
    end if

Paragraph about philosophy:
    “To run, or not to run,” thought the fox — “that is the question.”
    Was it instinct, curiosity, or just chaos theory unfolding?

 Multilingual test (for edge cases):  
    नमस्ते दुनिया! Bonjour le monde! Hola, mundo! Привет мир!  
    Mixed alphabets shouldn’t break the tokenizer.
